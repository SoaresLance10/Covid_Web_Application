# Covid_Web_Application

Hello and welcome to a demonstration of my submission for CS50w&#39;s Web programming with Python and JavaScript.

The web application I have created is a patient management system for a hospital to keep track of patients during this COVID pandemic.

The Web Application is created using HTML and CSS for the frontend, Django and Sqlite3 for the back end, JQuery, Bootstrap JS and addition JavaScript for styling and displaying information.

**INDEX PAGE** :

1. The index page has guidelines for the public to follow during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. It contains statistics of the patients admitted, patients recovered, bed available and doctors available in the hospital.
3. It contains an interactive map to display Global COVID-19 statistics in countries all over the world.
4. It contains Maps to display to the user, hospitals in his area as well as Testing Centers in his area.

**SERVICES PAGE** :

1. The Services page displays services provided by the hospital to the user, which are: Emergency Ambulance and Requesting at home Testing for COVID-19.
2. User are given Contact details to request for an Ambulance and are redirected to a Appointment Booking Page to request for At Home Testing

**LOGIN and REGISTER PAGE** :

1. Only Administrators in the hospital are allowed to have accounts. The information stored by the hospital is not accessible to the general public.
2. The general public is prevented from creating accounts as they are asked for an Authentication code that only administrators have access to.

**REQUEST ASSISTANCE PAGE** :

1. The general public can request medical attention form the doctors at the hospital by filling a form specifying the symptoms they face and contact details.
2. The doctors can look at these requests and contact these patients and can directly add these patients to the database in case they need to be admitted.

**ADD PATIENTS** :

1. The admins can add patients by filling a form asking for all their details.
2. All patients can we viewed in the all patients&#39; section.
3. You can also search through the database using the search form.
4. Clicking on any patient&#39;s name displays all the details pf the patient.
5. Here you can also update the details of any patient.

**PLASMA DONORS** :

1. Once a patient has recovered, his details are automatically stored in the Plasma Donors sections so that the hospital can approach these patients for plasma donation.

**ALL REQUESTS** :

1. All the requests submitted by users for medical assistance is seen by doctors here.
2. The requests are displayed in order of priority based on the age of the patients (higher the age higher priority)
3. Doctors can search through all requests using the search form.
4. They can either contact patients with the contact details they provided or can directly add them as a patient to the hospital.

**CHATBOT** :

1. The site also has a chat bot that gives you a self-assessment test and tells your risk of infection.
2. It gives you links to get more information about the Coronavirus.
3. It redirects to you more guidelines you must follow during the Pandemic.

Thankyou,
